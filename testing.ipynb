Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, this study’s key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and potential research directions based on our study.

I want to give you two ways to think about and categorize the algorithms you may come across in the field.  The first is a grouping of algorithms by their learning style. The second is a grouping of algorithms by their similarity in form or function (like grouping similar animals together). Both approaches are useful, but we will focus in on the grouping of algorithms by similarity and go on a tour of a variety of different algorithm types.  After reading this post, you will have a much better understanding of the most popular machine learning algorithms for supervised learning and how they are related.'}\n"
